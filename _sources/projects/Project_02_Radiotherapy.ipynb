Cell damage can lead to alteration and resulting risk of cancer, or cell death. Widespread cell death caused by high radiation doses can lead to organ failure [6], making it very dangerous.

If a deeper area of the body has a very high sensitivity to Dose, or is very important to protect from radiation, it could be best to angle the radiation dose *away* from that area, for example. It is also important to ensure that the beam is hitting the tumor as comprehensively as possible, which is dependent on the depth, shape, and size of the tumor. Overdosing the body or underdosing the tumor can cause additional health complications (such as more cancer or organ damage) or result in ineffective treatment [7].\n",

Beam angle optimization is a non-convex optimization problem, dependent on the location, size, and shape of the tumor, the sensitivity of the surrounding parts of the body, and the amount of radiation delivered, with a very large search space of possible angles. It usually involves selecting a set of angles, rather than just one, to create an optimal treatment plan. Therefore, this is an NP-hard combinatorial problem."
